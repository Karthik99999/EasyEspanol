        <h3>Indefinite Articles</h3>
        <p>As in English, we use the indefinite article in Spanish when we are talking about someone or something without specifying precisely which person or thing, e.g. "Do you have a pen (any pen)?" Although in English the indefinite article is always a/an, in Spanish the choice of indefinite article has to agree with the gender of the noun being referred to: un hombre, una cara, un coche, una casa.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The equivalent of the English 'some' as in I met some friends is unos (masculine) and unas (feminine).</p>

<h3>Definite Articles</h3>
<p>The definite article in Spanish is used when we are talking about a particular person or thing, e.g. "Do you have the tickets?" or "The street is crowded."
<br></br>
<br></br>
In English, the same definite article is used with all nouns, masculine, feminine and others: the man, the woman, the car, the house.
<br></br>
<br></br>
In Spanish, a different definite article is used depending on gender: el hombre, la mujer, el coche, la casa.
<br></br>
<br></br>
In English, the same definite article is used with all nouns, singular, plural, and uncountable/mass nouns: the man, the men; the woman, the women; the house, the houses; the rice; the fear.
<br></br>
<br></br>
In Spanish, a different definite article is used with singular and plural nouns: el hombre, los hombres; la mujer, las mujeres; el coche, los coches, la casa, las casas.
<br></br>
<br></br>
When something is mentioned for the first time, we often use an indefinite article; when we mention the same thing later, we often use a definite article.
<br></br>
Example: Estaba sentado en una silla. La silla se rompió. (He was sitting on a chair. The chair broke.)</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>The Neutral Article</h3>
<p>In Spanish, a neutral article is placed before an adjective which is being used as a noun.

Examples: Su conducción es lo peor. (His driving is the worst.) Lo interesante del libro son los ejercicios. (The interesting thing about the book is the exercises.) Lo raro es ... (The strange thing is ...).</p>
